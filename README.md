# getpopper.io website

This is the repository for the getpopper.io webpage. It uses the 
[Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy), which is a 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme for technical documentation sites, 
providing easy site navigation, structure, and more. You can find 
detailed theme instructions in the Docsy user guide at 
<https://docsy.dev/docs>

This website is hosted at <https://getpopper.io>.

## Running the website locally

Once you've cloned the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --volume $(PWD):/src \
  --volume $(PWD)/public:/target \
  --publish 1313:1313 \
  klakegg/hugo:0.67.0-ext server
```

The above supports hot-reloading, so any change made to a file should 
be reflected immediately (if no errors were generated).

## Deploy

Once changes are ready to be published, run:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The above generates the static site, and pushes it to the `master` 
branch, which is what github-pages reads in order to publish it to 
<https://getpopper.io>
